# Professional README Generator

## Description

Generates a professional README file from user inputs, utilizing Node.js's File System module, Inquirer.js, and template literals.

## Installation

This project depends on the Node.js File System module, so you will need to install that. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs). You will also need to install Inquirer.js (version 8.2.4). To do so, open your terminal in the "main" folder of this project and input the command `npm install inquirer@8.2.4`

## Usage

To use this README Generator, follow these instructions (as demonstrated in the video linked below). <br>
    1. Open your terminal in the "main" folder of this project and and input the command `node index.js` <br>
    2. Answer the prompts, providing the project title, a description, installation instructions, usage instructions, contribution guidelines, testing instructions, your GitHub username, and your email address, as well as picking a license to use. (This project currently limits your choices to the MIT license, the GNU GPL v3.0, or none.) <br>
